	The variable supports data binding.

	Field: FREQUESTEDIT
	When set, any attempt to directly change the property results in a call to IPropertyNotifySink::OnRequestEdit. The implementation of OnRequestEdit determines if the change is accepted.

	Field: FDEFAULTBIND
	The variable is the single property that best represents the object. Only one variable in type information can have this attribute.

	Field: FDEFAULTCOLLELEM
	Permits an optimization in which the compiler looks for a member named "xyz" on the type of abc. If such a member is found and is flagged as an accessor function for an element of the default collection, then a call is generated to that member function. Permitted on members in dispinterfaces and interfaces; not permitted on modules.

	The variable appears in an object browser, but not in a properties browser.
